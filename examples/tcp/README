This is a sample transport for X5 agent and transport which communicates by transferring messages serialized with binary EMF serialization via TCP sockets. 

To use this transport, do the following:
	1. Import all projects into eclipse
Server side:
	2. Export x5.server.tcp and x5.shared.tcp as JAR file
	3. Put this JAR file into <x5_server>/fantom-1.0.59/lib/java/ext/
	4. Put tcp.properties file into <x5_server/x5expert/transports/ directory (modify port number if necessary)
Client side:
	5. Include x5.client.tcp plugin into your eclipse installation/launch configuration
	6. Add dependency to x5.client.tcp bundle into MANIFEST.MF of the plugin defining X5 stream (com.xored.x5agent.core.tests by default)
	7. In stream configuration of plugin.xml provide the following transport configuration instead of existing one: (adjust port & host according to server side config):
	         
         <transport
               class="com.xored.x5.client.tcp.BinaryTcpTransport">
            <parameter
                  name="port"
                  value="9494" />
            <parameter
            	  name="host"
            	  value="localhost" />
         </transport>
